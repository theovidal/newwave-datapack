**🎈 Minecraft datapack for the NewWave server.**

## 🌈 Features

- Makes the games on the server work : PvP, Hikabrain, TNTrun and Totem
- Gives tools to moderators and administrators to manage the server

## 📥 Installation

You can either [download](https://github.com/exybore/newwave-datapack/archive/master.zip) the datapack or clone it using Github :

```bash
git clone https://github.com/exybore/newwave-datapack.git  # HTTP
git clone git@github.com:exybore/newwave-datapack          # SSH
```

Put it into the `datapack` folder of your Minecraft save. In-game, load it using the `/datapack enable "file/newwave"` command with operator privileges.

## 🔧 Setup

You must create different teams using the `/teams` command :

- an `admin` team : it'll have all rights and it's recommended to give them operator privileges
- a `moderator` team, which can have rights on players
- a `member` team : it's the default team for players
